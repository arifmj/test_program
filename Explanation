Suggestion for improvement on SQL QUERY

1. Indexes: Ensure that the columns used in the JOIN conditions, WHERE clause, and ORDER BY clause are indexed. This can significantly speed up the query execution.

2. Reduce the number of LEFT JOINs: If certain joins are not necessary for the result set, consider removing them. Each join adds complexity and can slow down the query.

3. Limit the number of selected columns: Only select the columns that are necessary for your application. This reduces the amount of data processed and transferred.

4. Pagination : Breaking query into smaller chunk using OFFSET and LIMIT to reduce number of records per request

5. Analyze the execution plan: Use the database's execution plan feature to identify bottlenecks in the query. (using EXPLAIN)
